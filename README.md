# Mod5-Challenge

Description:

Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on cancer treatments. Their treatment "Capomulin" is meant to be compared with other treatments in order to extract information on how successful it is.

In this project, two csv files are read in which contain information on studies of different treatments of squamous cell carcinoma with different drugs on mice. Python, Pandas, Scipy, and Matplotlib are used to arrange the data, create dataframes, calculate vital statistical values, and create visualizations so that decision makers may easily derive valuable details to inform their decisions.
